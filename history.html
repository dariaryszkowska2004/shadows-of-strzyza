    <h2>Strzyża and VII Dwór — History and Lesser-Known Places</h2>

    <p>
        The district of Strzyża is one of the oldest areas in Gdańsk. Its name comes from the
        stream that flows through it — the Strzyża Stream. The first mention of this place dates back
        to 1188, when the land belonged to the Cistercian monks from Oliwa.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        In the Middle Ages, the stream played a very important role — its fast current powered mills
        and forges, which became the foundation of local craftsmanship.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the 16th and 17th centuries, many manor houses and farms began to appear here, owned
        by wealthy citizens of Gdańsk. By the 18th century, there were as many as nine manors,
        giving the area a semi-rural character with scattered estates and gardens.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the 19th century, Strzyża started to take on a more urban form — blacksmith
        shops, military warehouses, and workers’ housing estates were built. In 1902, the district
        was officially incorporated into Gdańsk, and after World War II it became a peaceful
        residential area.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, Strzyża still hides several places that aren’t well known but are strongly connected
        to its past.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of them is General Maczek Square, once a military site and now a small, green public
        space where locals like to meet.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another is the “Srebrniki” retention reservoir, located in the valley of the Strzyża Stream — in
        the past, there were mills and forges there that gave the district its early industrial character.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also worth mentioning is the viewpoint near the Pomorska Metropolitan Railway tracks, from
        which you can see both Strzyża and the neighboring VII Dwór — it’s a quiet, charming spot
        rarely visited by tourists.
    </p>

    <p>
        The VII Dwór district has a different but equally fascinating history.
    </p>

    <p>
        Its beginnings also date back to the Middle Ages, when the land belonged to the Cistercian
        Abbey in Oliwa. Along today’s Polanki Street, the monks established summer residences for
        wealthy Gdańsk families. Each property was called a “Dwór” — meaning “Manor” — and
        numbered in sequence, which is how the name VII Dwór, or “Seventh Manor,” was born.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the 17th and 18th centuries, the area was famous for its beautiful estates, gardens, and
        orchards. After the partitions of Poland, most of these manors became private property, and
        in the 19th century Polanki Street turned into a popular walking and summer resort area.
    </p>

    <p>
        After World War II, construction began on the modern Osiedle Młodych housing estate,
        which today forms the heart of the district.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2014, VII Dwór was officially established as a separate administrative district of Gdańsk.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are also several lesser-known but interesting places here.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first is Polanki Street itself, where fragments of the old manor architecture can still be
        seen — including Manor VI and Manor VII on Abrahama Street.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another hidden gem is the “Lagry” Hill, a natural rise of about 90 meters above sea level. It’s
        one of the best viewpoints in this part of Gdańsk, offering a panorama of Strzyża, Oliwa, and
        Wrzeszcz.
    </p>

    <p>
        To sum up — Strzyża and VII Dwór are districts that reflect Gdańsk’s history from medieval
        monastic times to the modern day. Although they are less famous than the Old Town, they
        hide many places worth discovering — from old manors and mills to peaceful parks and hills
        that still preserve the atmosphere of the city’s rural past.
