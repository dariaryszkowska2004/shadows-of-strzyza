    <h1>About us</h1>

    <p>
        We are two students studying Historical Touris. We are passionate about travel, discovering
        new places, and learning about different cultures and histories around the world. Through
        our studies, we are especially interested in how local heritage, landscapes, and stories
        shape a place. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We are open-minded, curious, and communicative, and we enjoy working
        together, meeting new people, and exploring both well-known and hidden aspects of the
        places we visit — including our own city, Gdańsk. This passion and curiosity inspire us to
        create new initiatives and continue exploring the world in meaningful and creative ways.
    </p>

    <h2>Our goal</h2>

        Most visitors to Gdańsk stay around the Old Town and the seaside, missing the hidden
        beauty of the city’s inner districts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Strzyża and VII Dwór are full of natural and historical treasures — the Strzyża River, quiet
        forests of the Tri-City Landscape Park, old tenement houses, and even forgotten World War
        II bunkers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet these places remain undiscovered and underestimated by both tourists and locals.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
        Our goal is to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
           &nbsp Show the charm of Strzyża and VII Dwór through their mix of nature, history, and local life.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create walking and cycling routes connecting the river, forest trails, and historical spots.
        </li>
        <li>
            Promote sustainable tourism and respect for local heritage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Engage local residents to share stories and revive interest in their neighborhood.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We want to transform Strzyża and VII Dwór into a new kind of attraction — peaceful, green,
        and full of hidden stories, showing another, more authentic side of Gdańsk.
    </p>

    <h2>For who?</h2>

    <p>
        Our project is designed for travelers who want to discover the hidden side of Gdańsk —
        people who prefer authenticity over crowds.
    </p>

    <p>
        We aim to attract:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Young explorers and students (18–30) – curious about urban adventures,
            street photography, and alternative culture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nature lovers and hikers – interested in the Strzyża River, forest trails,
            and quiet green areas for walking or cycling.
        </li>
        <li>
            History and architecture enthusiasts – fascinated by forgotten places,
            old manors, bunkers, and local stories.
        </li>
        <li>
            Families and local residents – looking for peaceful activities,
            community events, and meaningful ways to spend time together.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These groups appreciate authentic experiences, hidden stories, and eco-friendly tourism
        that supports local communities and small businesses.
